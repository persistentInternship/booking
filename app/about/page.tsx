            Founded in 2023, DoorDash Home Services emerged from a simple idea: to bring the convenience and reliability of food delivery services to the world of home maintenance and improvement. Our founders, experienced in both technology and home services, saw an opportunity to bridge the gap between homeowners and service providers.

Today, we're proud to be a leading platform in the home services industry, continually innovating to meet the evolving needs of our customers and service providers.
